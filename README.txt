    Made for Minecraft v.1.15.2
    Created by TelepathicGrunt

Makes the potion effects and their icons remain when teleporting between dimensions using the /execute command or another mod's teleportation method.
The issue seems to be caused by some sort of packet problem not syncing all the info about effects on the player correctly.
