description='''You know the icon you see in top right corner when you get an effect like Regeneration? This mod makes sure that icon stays visible instead of disappearing for a bit when teleporting between dimensions using the /execute command or by other mod's teleportation means. Despite this mod's icon, Nether portals and End portals doesn't have this issue.'''
